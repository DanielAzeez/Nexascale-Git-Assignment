# Nexascale-Git-Assignment

### **Task 1: Version Control & Branching**

- Create a new Git repository on GitHub (or any Git hosting service).
- Clone the repository locally.
- Create a new branch called `feature-update`.
- Add a new file named `README.md` and write a short introduction about themselves.
- Commit the changes and push the `feature-update` branch to the remote repository.
- Open a pull request (PR) to merge `feature-update` into `main`.
- Merge the PR after reviewing changes.

### Process:  
1. I created a new Git repository on GitHub.  
2. The repository was cloned to my local machine.  
3. A new branch named `feature-update` was created to introduce changes separately from the `main` branch.  
4. I added a `README.md` file and wrote a short introduction about myself.  
5. I committed the changes and pushed the `feature-update` branch to GitHub.  
6. I opened a pull request (PR) to merge `feature-update` into `main`.  
7. After reviewing the PR, I merged it into the `main` branch.  

ðŸ“¸ **Screenshots of the process are included below:**

### **Task 2: Team Collaboration (Pair Programming)**

- One student should create a new repository and invite a team member as a collaborator.
- The owner should create an `index.html` file and push it to `main`.
- The collaborator should clone the repo, create a new branch (`update-styles`), and modify `index.html` by adding a `<style>` section.
- The collaborator should commit and push the changes, then open a PR.
- The repository owner should review, approve, and merge the PR.
- Both students should pull the latest changes to their local machines.

### Process - Collaboration with Ardent Soma:  
1. I created a new repository and added **Ardent Soma** as a collaborator.  
2. I created an `index.html` file and pushed it to the `main` branch.  
3. The collaborator (**Ardent Soma**) cloned the repository and created a new branch named `update-styles`.  
4. **Ardent Soma** modified `index.html` by adding a basic styling section.  
5. The changes were committed and pushed to the `update-styles` branch.  
6. A pull request (PR) was opened for review.  
7. I reviewed, approved, and merged the PR.  
8. Both of us pulled the latest updates to ensure our local repositories were in sync.  

ðŸ“¸ **Screenshots of the collaboration have been added to this repository.**

### **Task 3: Resolving Merge Conflicts**

- Each student should create a repository and clone it.
- Create a new branch (`edit-text`) and modify an existing file (or create one).
- Switch back to `main` and modify the same file in a different way.
- Merge `edit-text` into `main` to intentionally create a merge conflict.
- Resolve the conflict, commit the changes, and push the final version.

### Process:  
1. I created a new repository and cloned it locally.  
2. I created a new branch (`edit-text`) and modified an existing file.  
3. I switched back to `main` and modified the same file in a different way.  
4. When merging `edit-text` into `main`, a **merge conflict occurred** due to different modifications in the same file.  
5. I manually resolved the conflict by choosing the appropriate changes.  
6. I committed and pushed the resolved file to GitHub.

### **Task 4: Working with a Remote Repository**

- Fork a repository from a popular open-source project on GitHub.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
- Create a new branch called `documentation-update`.
- Make meaningful changes to the documentation files ([README.md](http://README.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](http://CONTRIBUTING.md), etc.).
- Commit the changes with appropriate commit messages.
- Push the branch to your fork.
- Create a pull request to the original repository.
- Document the process and any feedback received on the pull request.

### Process- Contribution to Open Source:  
1. I forked a popular open-source repository, **[firstcontributions/first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)**.  
2. I cloned the forked repository to my local machine.  
3. I created a new branch named `documentation-update`.  
4. I added my contribution to the `Contributors.md` file with the message:  
   > *"Hello everyone. Happy to be here, and hope to contribute more on open-source projects in the nearest future!"*  
5. I committed the changes and pushed them to the `documentation-update` branch.  
6. I opened a pull request (PR) to the original repository.  
7. The PR was reviewed and successfully merged.
